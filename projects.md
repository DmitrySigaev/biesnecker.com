A small, non-exhaustive list of projects I've worked on recently.

- [Is my team going to win?](http://biesnecker.com/2014/10/16/how-likely-is-it-that-my-team-will-win/): using [Retrosheet](http://retrosheet.org/) data to calculate the odds of each baseball team in a game winning based on the run differential at the end of each half inning.
- [MLB team colors in hexadecimal](http://biesnecker.com/2014/10/10/mlb-team-colors-in-hexadecimal/): my first attempt at building something in React. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
