My name is John Biesnecker. I'm married and a father of two living in Austin, Texas. I work for Facebook but, obviously, my opinions are my own and don't represent my employer's views (or anyone else's, for that matter).

I write a lot of code for my day job, and that is the primary focus of this blog. I will likely go off on tangents from time to time, but hopefully they will be productive ones.

I'm active in a couple of other places, including:

* [Facebook](http://facebook.com/biesnecker)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/biesnecker)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@biesnecker)
* [Github](http://github.com/biesnecker)
* [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/john.biesnecker)

Under the hood, this website is built with Jekyll, the static website generator, dressed up with [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) / [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), and served from Amazon S3.

Thanks for reading!
