title: MLB team colors in hexadecimal

    You might never need to know the hexadecimal values of your favorite baseball team's colors, but if you do, this is your jam. More importantly, it's a good opportunity to play with React.js, Facebook's open source javascript framework.

<div id="mlb-colors-root"></div>

{% javascript mlb_colors %}

Have you ever been watching a baseball game and thought "you know what, those garish Miami Marlins uniforms are the perfect color scheme for my next project"? If so, have I got a single-serving web application for you. Just pick your favorite team and copy the colors, presented in friendly web-ready RGB hexidecimal triplets, into your next billion dollar startup's CSS file.

But seriously --

This is my very first [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) project. It's not much to look at, but it took a while to figure out how things are supposed to go together. I think I understand it a little more than I did a couple of hours, though, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other things I can write in Javascript in the future. Definitely a nice weapon to have in my arsenal.
