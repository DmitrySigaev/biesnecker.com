title: Why I'm betting on Javascript

    Sometimes you just need to focus your efforts in one direction for a little while to maximize your impact. For me, that direction is going to be Javascript, because I think it's the language of the future.

I've long been a proponent of polyglot programming, in which you use a combination of languages in application development so as to benefit from the strengths of each of them. That said, I think it's time for me to focus a little bit and go deep, and I'm betting that Javascript is the language with which to go deep.

Why Javascript? I have a couple of reasons.

#### Javascript is ubiquitous

The platform I care about is the web, and on the web Javascript is everywhere. It's on you phone, it's on your desktop -- it's probably on your fancy [IoT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)-enabled refrigerator. It's even on your [car's dashboard](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/car-tech/the-new-tesla-s-has-the-most-insane-in-car-touchscreen-multimedia-system-ever-1185159) (if your car happens to be a $100K electric supercar). This is important.

Despite all of the fancy new languages out there, C remains not just in use but indeed the default language for many domains. There are several reasons for this, but one of those is that C compilers are available for just about any platform or device you can imagine. If it exists and an crunch numbers, someone has probably written a C compiler for it. If you're an aspiring systems programmer, learning C is a decent idea, because there are plenty of opportunities to use it.

Javascript is the same, but for high level languages. Because everyone has access to the Javascript runtime (in their browser on whatever device they're using), everyone can run your code. Javascript + HTML + CSS + the Internet = a distributed, high availability, virtually free platform upon which you can write GUI applications, and even your mom knows how to get the application and run it (by typing a URL into the browser address bar). I love Python, I really do, but distributing Python apps is painful, whereas "distributing" Javascript applications is (thanks to solid libraries that pave over browser differences) virtually painless.

#### Javascript is fast

There's been so much written on Javascript performance over the years, and so much of it is outdated. But modern Javascript is fast. Is it as fast as C/C++? No. But it's as fast or faster than most other interpreted languages. And, it's available everywhere. If you want an example of how fast Javascript can be, run [this Unity3D WebGL demo](http://beta.unity3d.com/jonas/AngryBots/) on any reasonably fast machine. It's nuts.

#### Javascript is native to the web

There are plenty of people who look down on Javascript _because_ it's "just a web scripting language," but for me that's a plus. I love the web, and I believe in the web (rather than apps) as the future of the internet. The web is open and extensible, and that matters a lot. We can all have a place on the web, and publish and consume content as we see fit. I want to be fluent with the language that supports this, and that's Javascript.

#### Big players support Javascript

Google built [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/). Facebook built [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react). Joyent built [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node). These are all large companies with significant resources, and they're developing in Javascript. That says to me that they have a vested interest in maintaining the Javascript ecosystem, which is a good thing for anyone who writes Javascript.

#### Javascript is in demand

I'm not looking for a job right now but it's nice to know that Javascript is [consistently one of the most sought after languages](http://www.ryan-williams.net/hacker-news-hiring-trends/2014/september.html) when tech companies hire.

### Conclusion

I'll continue to write Python and PHP at my [day job](http://facebook.com/), but that doesn't mean I can't focus my after-hours projects on Javascript (and it doesn't mean I'll never use Javascript at work -- Facebook, as mentioned above, uses Javascript extensively). I believe that Javascript will be the C/C++ of this generation -- well-supported, perfomant, and used in a variety of domains.

What do you think?
