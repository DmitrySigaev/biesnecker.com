    The curse of the modern age is that everything sucks, and everyone knows it. But everything will always suck, and that is liberating.

Everything sucks. It's the curse of the modern era. Ask anyone — almost every system, interaction, and design that the average person encounters on an average day sucks. And it's not getting any better. New stuff is being built all the time, and it sucks, too. Does it suck less than the old stuff? Impossible to say. But it really and truly does suck.

### First world problems suck

When my wife was pregnant with our first child, I remember reading a book about parenting — because obviously that is something that one can learn from a book — containing a passage about dealing with your child's problems that really stuck with me. I don't have it to quote verbatim, but essentially it said that no matter how trivial the problem seemed to you as a card-carrying adult, you need to treat your child as if he or she has a really and truly serious problem, because from the child's perspective it really and truly is a serious problem. To do less is to disrespect your child, because growing up is hard.

This is how I see so-called “First World Problems” — despite their objectively trivial nature, a first world problem is subjectively still a problem to the person experiencing it. A little perspective helps, but the existence of war and hunger and disease does not make it any less ridiculous that Apple ships all of their products with charging cables that are too short for any reasonable use, does it? Well, maybe it does, but please don't tell me that when I'm trying to reach the only power outlet in my hotel room, mmkay?

### All technology sucks

The iPhone 6 is pretty sweet, right? Nope, [it sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi3oEYda_2c). Indeed, you can type “[name of technology] sucks” into Google and find a raft of articles decrying that technology. Here are a few fun places to start:


* [Tesla sucks](https://www.google.com/#q=tesla+sucks)
* [Facebook sucks](https://www.google.com/#q=facebook+sucks)
* [Nginx sucks](https://www.google.com/#q=nginx+sucks)
* [PHP sucks](https://www.google.com/#q=php+sucks) (so does [every other programming language](https://wiki.theory.org/YourLanguageSucks))
* [GPS sucks](https://www.google.com/#q=gps+sucks)

I'm not just trying to point out that we overuse the word “sucks” (though we probably do), but rather the impression that so much of what we use every day is subpar, and probably should be replaced by something that “doesn't suck,” whatever that may be.

### Everything is a compromise

There are no global optimums. Everything is a compromise, and everything sucks because, eventually, you're going to need that which was given away as part of the compromise. Even Mother Nature, that blind experimenter whose access to experimental subject is equalled in magnitude only by her disregard for the welfare of those subjects, compromises. Cancer really fucking sucks, but cell division is pretty cool, isn't it? To think that [Jony Ive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive) can consistently do better is a tad bit unrealistic, isn't it?

I find it helpful to think about it as an extension of the [Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). When faced with a series of problems that you must solve in order to move forward, it is almost always preferable to have five 80% solutions, rather than a single 100% solution, in a given amount of time (this doesn't always hold true — rockets and pacemakers  and submarine pressure hulls and the like need to be a little closer to the latter than the former, but for most of what we do it does). But when you give a product composed of 80% solutions to a large enough group of people and have them poke on it for a long enough period of time (the UX testing version of the million monkeys at a million typewriters, I suppose), one of them will eventually find a pressing, unavoidable need for something that fell in the discarded 20% bucket, and not having it will suck.

### Everything will always suck

You have two choices:

1. Wait until you've anticipated every potential use case of your product and solved each of those use cases with 100% effectiveness, and then release your product to the world;
2. Release something that solves the problem at hand as elegantly as you can manage right now, let people tell you that your product sucks and that you should be ashamed of yourself, and iterate.

Because Choice #1 means that you will never, ever release your product, the only choice that matters is Choice #2. Given enough time everything that you do will suck, and that's OK. It's better to release something into the world and be told that it sucks than to never let your work see the light of day.

I don't know about you, but this is liberating. I'm the sort of person that naturally falls into Choice #1, not wanting to let others see what I've done until I'm 100% sure that it is perfect, and as a result I can be startlingly unproductive if I'm not careful. Understanding that no matter how hard I try, given a distant enough time horizon anything that I produce that isn't absolutely trivial will suck frees me from worrying too much about what I can't anticipate. All I can do is do my best, solve the problems that I can see, and work hard to continue improving both my ability to solve problems elegantly and my ability to see (both of which push “suck” further into the future, but do not eliminate it entirely). Perfection is unattainable, and as such isn't a worthy goal.

### Sucks != Sloppy

This is important. If something sucks because it's broken right out of the gate, or just doesn't solve the problem it is intended to solve, then it is sloppy and shouldn't have been released. The idea that everything that you do will eventually suck isn't a free pass to do shitty work. If you're not solving the immediate problem with your work then you're not doing it right, and you should be ashamed of yourself. That's not to say that you won't sometimes, perhaps even frequently, attempt to do something, fail, and fall short, but that shouldn't be your goal. You should be proud of what you produce, just not too proud, given what you know about its inevitable decline.

### The world is built on things that suck

The first electrical grids sucked. The current electrical grids suck, but they are a lot better than the first ones. And the first ones enabled all sorts of industry that just wasn't possible before their existence, despite their shortcomings. In the future, our electrical grids will continue to improve, and they will continue to suck, but they'll suck at new things. The next time you think “man, XYZ sure does suck,” take a step back and think about how much work went in to making it suck at that specific task, and not all the many hundreds or thousands of tasks that it could suck at. That, friends, is progress.
