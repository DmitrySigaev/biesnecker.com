  There honestly aren't that many developers I really and truly look up to, but John Carmack is definitely one of them.

It doesn't really matter that my new favorite programming language is also being used by legendary (and, heh, [my coworker](http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/30/5563614/john-carmack-speaks-up-about-facebook-buying-oculus-vr)) John Carmack. But it's a nice feeling nonetheless, and helps dissuade those "can I really do XYZ in this language" fears.

Of course, John's been talking about functional programming for some time now, and Racket fits the bill without being overly orthodox about it (like Haskell). As he said in a [2012 piece](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php): 

> There is a continuum of value in how pure a function is, and the value step from almost-pure to completely-pure is smaller than that from spaghetti-state to mostly-pure.

Racket clearly makes that step in a pretty elegant way.
