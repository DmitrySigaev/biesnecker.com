title: The one where my company failed

summary: >
    I tried, and I failed. I was incredibly naive about the amount of work that it would take, and I was incredibly naive in my understanding of what drives me and what I'm passionate about. It sucked. But it's better now.

I haven't told this story very often, but was inspired to by my friend Frank Fradella's difficult and honest [post-mortem of his failed startup](https://medium.com/@frankfradella/10-things-i-learned-running-a-startup-9c15571008ae). As a culture we talk about failing fast and embracing risk, but for the individual failure fucking sucks. It might be part of the job, and is definitely what makes [the startup scene as a whole work](https://medium.com/@biesnecker/startups-are-fragile-but-the-startup-community-is-antifragile-74858b446ef4), but that doesn't make it suck any less. Talking about it is cathartic, though, and does indeed reduce the suck. So I'm going to talk about it.

### Act One

In the fall of 2008 I was really unhappy with my job. I worked for a Shanghai-based startup (throughout this I'm not going to name names -- yes there were other people involved, but this failure is on me), and though I enjoyed the work that I did, my relationship with my manager (one of the founders) was toxic and taking its toll. At some point near the end of the year I started looking for something else.

I found it in a small startup that was founded by an acquaintance of mine (and, ultimately, was purchased by a large media company for a large chunk of change, so take my description below with a grain of salt, because obviously it worked out well for them). I started on the first Monday in 2009. I was excited, but that excitement quickly faded. I found myself in interminable meeting after interminable meeting. I asked the founder/CEO if that was normal -- he laughed and said that they were doing something that nobody else had done before (which was true), and so they had to figure everything out on their own, and that took a lot of talking.

A *lot* of talking.

And very little decision making. I remember clearly the day that I decided I couldn't take it anymore. I had spent the entire afternoon in an "internal marketing" meeting, in which we discussed which motivational slogans to make into posters, and where to hang those posters. The *entire afternoon*. And then I did an afternoon's worth of work, leaving the office around 10pm. I remember calling my wife on the way home and saying that I was done.

### Act Two

I didn't know what I was going to do, though. The default choice for young expatriates was to teach English to pay the bills and keep one's work visa valid, but [there was no way in hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nt8_FCI4JE) I was going back to that. I decided to freelance as a software developer, focusing on iOS development (this was the early days, and [app millionaires](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/other-phones/app-store-millionaires-share-their-secrets-524586) were all over the news). I don't even remember how I made it known that I was going to do this -- I think I just told my friends and they told their friends (a benefit of having been part of the early English-language web community in China was that I had (and have -- though I miss my China peeps!) a pretty decent set of friends), and got a couple of contracts early on to build apps for reasonably well-known entities in Shanghai and Beijing.

When those were finished, though, not much more came. As the summer of 2009 rolled into autumn, the money that my wife and I had saved began to dwindle, and I decided that writing apps for other people wasn't going to work. Instead, I started building apps under my company's own name and releasing them. Most did absolutely nothing. One, a quirky little game called KanaBalls ([randomly reviewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73uBYSxrezE)), ended up doing pretty well (ironically, a month before I called it quits and started looking for a job again it rose to the #1 educational app in several markets for reasons I still don't understand, and made back at least some of the money that I had lost). The code for it is [available on Github now](https://github.com/biesnecker/Kanaballs), if you're interested in circa 2009 Objective-C/Cocos2D written by someone who had never written an interactive game before.

### Act Three

By early 2010, it was clear that my freelance career wasn't going to pay the bills, and that I needed a job. I ended up back at the startup that I had left at the end of 2008, and worked there for a couple more years. It was the right move, both financially and because I got to do a lot of interesting work, and think about a lot of interesting problems that, four years on, are the problems about which I'm passionate.

### Lessons learned

- **Being a freelancer / founder is more about selling than it is about making.** Of course you have to produce quality products / offer quality services, but that's a whole lot easier than selling those products or services. I was totally ignorant of this going in, which seems incredible in retrospect, but those are the facts.
- **You have to understand what motivates you, and find a partner that compliments those motivations and fills in the gaps.** Selling did not, and does not, motivate me. I like to solve problems. I like to build things. I don't find any joy in pitching an investor, or sitting through (incredibly important!) business meetings with prospective clients. Given #1, above, if you're like me (and I think a lot of "technical founders" are) then you simply *must* find a partner that enjoys that part of the business.
- **Working alone is hard.** Beyond needing a partner or two that complements your strengths with strengths of his or her own, you also need other people because *you need other people* -- working alone is incredibly hard. I wasn't prepared for that.
- **Your experience in a company is your responsibility.** The most fundamental lesson I learned was actually about how I left the company I was at in the beginning of this story. It's true that my relationship with my manager was toxic (and I wasn't the only one who felt that way working with him), but I placed all of the responsibility for making things better on the company, and didn't take charge of it myself. This was stupid, because your experience is largely of your own making, which means you're responsible for improving it when it sours. There's a ton of things I could have done to make my life at that company better, and I didn't attempt any of them. I won't make that mistake again.

### Conclusion

Failure sucks, but it's a great teacher. Ultimately, the lessons I learned are far more valuable than the savings that I lost in learning them. It wasn't any fun, and it was incredibly stressful for me and my family, but things are *much* better now, and that is at least in part thanks to having gone through this experience. I am so much smarter now about how I manage side projects against my full-time job, and how I invest my time and money into ideas. I also understand myself a lot better than I did, and that has led me to make much better decisions about what I want to do than I could have made without this experience.

It gets better.
