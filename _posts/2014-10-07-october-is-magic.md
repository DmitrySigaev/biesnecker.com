    If you're not a baseball fan I'm not going to convince you, and if you are then you already know, but man... October is magic, isn't it?

Matt Adams hit .190 against left handers during the regular season. He was terrible against lefties. Most of the time it felt like he was just standing up there for long enough to get the out and go sit down when there was a southpaw on the mound.

Clayton Kershaw, a left handed pitcher, held left handers to a .193 average during the regular season, giving up just a single home run. He's one of the great pitchers of this era.

But then, in the 7th inning of Game 4 of the NLDS, with his team down 2-0 and facing a scary return to LA to play a win-or-go-home Game 5, Matt Adams cranks a three-run home run into the bullpen behind the right field wall, sticking Kershaw with the loss.

Cardinals win and head to their fourth straight NLCS. The Dodgers head home, wondering what that massive payroll got them.

October, man. October.
