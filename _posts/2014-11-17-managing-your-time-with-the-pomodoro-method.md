    Though I've not found many of the life hacking techniques espoused online to be particularly useful, the Pomodoro Method is an exception, and has been a great way to focus my productive time.

The one “life hacking” technique I’ve been able to stick with is the [Pomodoro Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Created by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Method gets its name from the Italian word for tomato, which was in turn inspired by a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that he used while in college.

The concept is simple: work for 25 minutes, take a short (3-5 minute) break, and then start another cycle. After ~4 of these cycles, take a longer break (25-30 minutes). These 30-minute blocks are called *pomodori*, the Italian plural of *pomodoro*. It fits well into a normal day’s calendar, with each work cycle scheduled for 30 minutes, of which 25 minutes is reserved for work and the final 5 minutes is reserved for rest.

The idea is that you work better when you can focus intensely on your work, but most people are unable to maintain intense focus for very long at any one time. It’s easier to focus for 25 minutes on nothing but work when you know that a short break is coming at the end. It’s important, though, that you aren’t distracted when you’re working — incoming distractions need to either be totally avoided or filed away for later processing, or you need to abandon the 25-minute work block in progress and handle them.

### Setting a goal

Whenever I start a new *pomodoro* I try to set a goal for myself. Not everything can be done in 25 minutes, of course, but a surprising number of things *can* be finished in that span of time if you put your mind to it. This is a form of *timeboxing*, in which you set a strict limit on the amount of time that you’ll spend on a task, rather than the scope of the work to be done. When you run out of time, you stop, and that’s the work you move forward with, rather than working until all of the work is actually done.

This post, in fact, is being written in an early Sunday morning *pomodoro*, and will probably be edited in another one later before posting it. I could talk for a long while about this approach to time management and how it has (and hasn’t) worked for me, but I’m 100% more likely to publish *something*, even if it’s not the perfect thing, if I box my time appropriately and only work until the timer expires.

### A typical day

My Monday is generally meeting heavy (though this one isn't too bad), so I only try to fit six *pomodori* into my schedule. It looks something like this:

I don’t always get to all of them — life (and work) happens — but I’m trying to be more aggressive in blocking off my time and focusing on getting things done while I’m at the office (and conversely getting much less done at home, and spending more time with my family). The Pomodoro Method has been wonderful in making this happen.

### How many *pomodori*?

I shoot for 8 *pomodori* per day. I find it difficult, with ever-present external demands, to block off more than 4 hours to focus solely on individual tasks. Also, 4 hours of intensely focused software development starts to hit the limits of my productive mental capacity, and thus I don’t know how much adding additional *pomodori* into my day would increase my output.

That’s not to say that I only work four hours per day — sadly, that’s not the case. I don’t try to wrap everything into a *pomodori*, though, and a decent portion of my day is spent in meetings with others who aren’t always amenable to my schedule.

### Conclusion

The Pomodoro Method has been an effective way for me to manage my productive time, and is something that I’ve continued using while many other life hacking techniques have long since fallen by the wayside. I think that this is because it’s both simple — all you need is a timer — and integrates well with “normal” life — what’s more normal than 30-minute blocks in Outlook? If you’re struggling to find productive time in your day, I’d recommend giving it a shot and seeing if it works for you, too.
